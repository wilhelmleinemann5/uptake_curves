You can read more about how to get started with design tokens in code under <PageLink path=\"/develop/#general-guide-on-using-mds-in-your-application\">Get Started for Developers</PageLink>.\n\nMaersk Design System design tokens cover:\n\n- Typography\n- Colours\n- Borders\n- Shadows\n- Transitions\n\n## Global, Density, Brand and Implementation tokens\n\nMaersk Design System design tokens are structured under three main categories - _Global, Brand, Density and Implementation_.\n\n### Global tokens\n\n<PageLink path=\"/design-language/themes/global-tokens/\">Global tokens</PageLink> are fixed values that make up the Maersk Design System DNA - this includes e.g. size, transition and layout.\n\n### Density tokens\n\n<PageLink path=\"/design-language/themes/global-tokens/\">Density tokens</PageLink> define the spacing values for three different density settings supported by the MDS: _Default, Compact and Spacious_.\n\n### Brand tokens\n\nBrand tokens (brand and brand_appearance) are all the tokens that are used to create a brand, but also the tokens used for variations under a brand (also called brand-appearance).\n\nBelow you see an example of the themes <PageLink path=\"/design-language/themes/maersk/light/\">Maersk Light</PageLink> and <PageLink path=\"/design-language/themes/maersk/dark/\">Maersk Dark</PageLink> applied to this website.\n\nYou can also switch between these two themes by clicking the sun/moon icon in the header.\n\n<Grid2Cols>\n  <Example \n    caption=\"Maersk Light theme\"\n    imageSrc=\"./_images/light.png\"\n  />\n  <Example \n    caption=\"Maersk Dark theme\"\n    imageSrc=\"./_images/dark.png\"\n  />\n</Grid2Cols>\n\n## Naming convention\n\nEach of the Maersk Design System design tokens follows the same naming convention that makes it possible to organise them into meaningful categories, which in the end makes them easier to understand and use.\n\nAll the Maersk Design System design tokens are created based on the following naming convention - where only depth, item, and attribute are mandatory:\n\n<Example\n>\n  <div style=\"text-align: center;\">depth_item_variant_platform_state_attribute</div>\n</Example>\n\nBelow is an example of how this naming convention is applied to the design tokens:\n\n<Example\n>\n  <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    global_link_stand-alone_hover_text-decoration<br /><br />\n    brand_typography_headline_large_mobile_font-size<br /><br />\n    brand_appearance_primary_default_background-color\n  </div>\n</Example>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n| Depth* | Item* | Variant | Platform | State | Attribute\\* |\n|------------------|------------|----------------|----------|-------|------------------|\n| global | border | | | | style |\n| global | transition | slow | | | duration |\n| global | link | inline | | hover | text-decoration |\n| global | link | stand-alone | | hover | text-decoration |\n| brand | typography | headline_large | mobile | | font-size |\n| brand | typography | headline_large | desktop | | font-size |\n| brand_appearance | primary | default | | | background-color |\n| brand_appearance | primary | weakest | | | background-color |\n| core | button | | | | border-width |\n| core | button | primary_filled | | | background-color |\n| core | button | primary_filled | | hover | background-color |\n\n<br />\n<div class=\"mds-text--small-normal\">* = mandatory</div>\n\n## Using design tokens in code\n\nFor developers, we have made a guide on how to get started with the <PageLink path=\"/develop/#general-guide-on-using-mds-in-your-application\">Theming and MDS Design Tokens</PageLink>. The guide includes:\n\n- How to install\n- How to use\n- How to use in application code\n- How to create a mapping file for MDS design tokens\n- How to switch themes\n"
