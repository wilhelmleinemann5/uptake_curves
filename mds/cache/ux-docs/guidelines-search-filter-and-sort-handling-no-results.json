In this case users will expect they can enter any keyword, number or phrase.\n\n### Search query is not properly formatted.\n\nFor example if people use incorrect search operators e.g. using a comma instead of a space between search terms. This could also happen if the UI is does not support auto-formatting or does not have guiding labels and placeholders.\n\n### Too narrow scope\n\nFor example, if a search is limited to a specific date range or category and there are no matching items within that range or category, no results will be returned.\n\n### Search query doesn't match any data in the system.\n\nThis could happen if the search terms are misspelled or if the data being searched is incomplete, inaccurate or does not match one to one the input.\n\n### Technical issues with the database being searched.\n\nThis could be due to issues with indexing or database connectivity.\n\n## Our recommendation to handle these cases\n\nThe overall recommendation is to aim for prevention and in the worst case provide a fallback for no results page that displays clear system feedback and a way for the user to recover.\n\n### Communicate what to expect from the search and filtering\n\n- Provide as much guidance in advance to help people understand what are the capabilities of the product application to find information\n- Communicate what formats are supported - if there are any restrictions.\n- Apply autocomplete and suggestions to assist in inputting the correct values that can lead to results in the search.\n\n### Prevent wrong input as much as possible\n\n- Allow only input that is accepted and formatted correctly so it increases the chance of users to getting the information they need.\n- When using the <PageLink path=\"/guidelines/search-filter-and-sort/filter-patterns/#live-or-batch-filtering/\">live filtering concept</PageLink>, aim to provide filters that can return results. If possible indicate how many results each filtering option will add.\n\n### Provide clear system feedback\n\nIf users can still submit input that will return no results, provide clear feedback to them. A way to do that is to use the Invalid state of the <PageLink path=\"/components/input/#error-state/\">input component</PageLink> or/and the <PageLink path=\"/components/notification/\">notification component</PageLink>.\n\n### No results page state\n\nEven when communication and system feedback is clear and in place to correct the input, people might still get to a dead end in their search journey. This is why it is important to design and implement a no-results page that clearly communicates the issue and what actions people can take.\n"
