(_e.g. 50 years of range might be unnecessary_)\n- Display the weeks numbers only when the context requires it and when users expect to see them by default.\n\n<Notification>\nThis component is used in <PageLink path=\"/components/input-date\">Input date</PageLink> component. It can be used as the basis for custom date and time selection components and patterns.\n</Notification>\n\n## Restrict selectable dates (min and max)\n\nUse the min or the max attribute to restrict the dates that can be selected and accepted by the component.  \n \nThe min defines the earliest date that the component will accept and will disable the dates in the calendar that are before the min date.\n \nThe max defines the latest date that the component will accept and will disable the dates in the calendar that are after the max date.\n \nUse both the min and the max attributes to define a range of selectable and accepted dates. In such cases, the max value must be later than or equal to the min value.\n"
