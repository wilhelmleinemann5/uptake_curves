Good labels and hint text can help to do that.\n- Combine input time with an <PageLink path=\"/components/input-date/\">input date</PageLink> when you want to relate time to a specific date.\n- Help the user understand what time zone the selected time value belongs to.\n- Consider providing less granularity for the minutes in the input time (default 00 to 59). For example, quarter-hour intervals (00, 15, 30, and 45).\n- Aim to use the default 24-hour format since it is widely used in Logisitcs industry.\n- Use natural language and use the terms that people would expect for label and hint text.\n- Don't use verbs like enter, add, input, etc in the label.\n- Don't add a colon ( : ) at the end of the label.\n\n<Notification>\nWe recommend that you check out the <PageLink path=\"/guidelines/forms\">Forms</PageLink> and <PageLink path=\"/content/date-and-time/\">Date & Time</PageLink> guidelines to help you design and develop good experience for the people using your product.\n</Notification>\n\n## Label\n\nBy default, the component has a top-positioned label. It is possible to change the position of the label to be left-positioned. We recommend that you use the top-positioned labels wherever possible, especially in forms. You can read more about why we recommend top-positioned labels in our <PageLink path=\"/guidelines/forms/#label-positioning\">form guidelines</PageLink>.\n\nFor information on how to write good and consistent labels - see our <PageLink path=\"/content/labels/#form-field-labels\">Label Guidelines</PageLink>.\n\n## Hint text & error state\n\nPlease see the <PageLink path=\"/components/input\">Input component</PageLink> for details on <PageLink path=\"/components/input#hint-text\">hint text</PageLink> and <PageLink path=\"/components/input#error-state\">error state</PageLink>.\n\n## Vanity variant\n\nThe component supports the \"vanity\" style variant. \n\nPlease read more about this variant on our <PageLink path=\"/guidelines/forms#vanity-field-variant\">form guidelines page</PageLink>.\n\n## Examples\n\nCommon scenarios of how this component could be used.\n\n### Date and time together\n\nThe following example uses the <PageLink path=\"/components/input-date\">input date component</PageLink> for date and time input.\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/example-1.svg\"\n  caption=\"When time needs to be related to a specific date.\"\n/>\n\n### Time Range\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/example-2.svg\"\n  caption=\"When time range needs to be selected, use two components together.\"\n/>\n\n"
