For high urgency where the user needs to take action before continuing, use the <PageLink path=\"/components/modal\">Modal component</PageLink> as a dialog.\n\nSee our <PageLink path=\"/guidelines/system-feedback\">System Feedback Guidelines</PageLink> for more information on system feedback in general.\n</Notification>\n\n## Usage\n\nUse the toast component for low-disruption feedback and feedback that is mainly task-triggered due to its immediate nature.\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/usage.svg\"\n  caption=\"Default toast.\"\n/>\n\n### Placement\n\nToasts should be used in a consistent manner and should be place in the same location on the screen across the whole application. The default toast position is set at the top right corner. Display the toast on the same page as where the action took place so that it is easy for the user to understand the connection.\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/placement.svg\"\n/>\n\n### Stacking\n\nAvoid stacking more than 3 different toast messages at the same time to avoid increasing cognitive load.\n\n<Grid2Cols>\n  <Example\n    imageSrc=\"./_images/stacking-do.svg\"\n    indicator=\"success\"\n  />\n  <Example\n    imageSrc=\"./_images/stacking-dont.svg\"\n    indicator=\"success\"\n  />\n</Grid2Cols>\n\n### Actions\n\nThe toast is based on the <PageLink path=\"/components/notification\">notification component</PageLink> and support actions (<PageLink path=\"/components/button\">Buttons</PageLink> and <PageLink path=\"/components/link\">Links</PageLink>) that can be used to provide shortcuts and low-importance actions. e.g. “Undo”, “Retry”, “View more” etc.\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/actions-1.svg\"\n  caption=\"Toast with action button placed inline.\"\n/>\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/actions-2.svg\"\n  caption=\"Toast with action link placed inline.\"\n/>\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/actions-3.svg\"\n  caption=\"Toast with action buttons placed underneath the message and an avatar placed in the icon slot.\" \n/>\n\n### Appearances\n\nThe toast has the following appearances:\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/appearances-1.svg\"\n  caption=\"Neutral default.\"\n/>\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/appearances-2.svg\"\n  caption=\"Neutral inverse.\"\n/>\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/appearances-3.svg\"\n  caption=\"Info - for more general information about changes in the application e.g. announcements about product updates.\" \n/>\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/appearances-4.svg\"\n  caption=\"Success - when a task or a process has successfully been completed.\"\n/>\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/appearances-5.svg\"\n  caption=\"Warning - when something in the application has changed that is important that the user is aware about.\"\n/>\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/appearances-6.svg\"\n  caption=\"Error - when error has occured within the application that demands immediate attention.\"\n/>\n\n<Notification appearance=\"warning\">\nAvoid using a toast for critical error messages since users might not see it in time or be able to act on the feedback. The <PageLink path=\"/components/notification\">notification component</PageLink> is more suitable for communicating critical information that should be seen.\n</Notification>\n\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe toast component content is implemented as an 'ARIA live region' using aria-live=\"polite\". When the toast appears, screen readers will announce the toast text only after any other more pressing announcements.\n\nIf a user has set up on their machine a preference to reduce motion, the animation on the toast will be disabled.\n\nAvoid using toast for critical information that people need to act on immediately.\n\nToast might be difficult for people with low vision or dexterity to access. In case you want people to be able to use the keyboard navigation to reach the toast content, make sure to provide enough duration time before the toast is automatically discarded.\n\n"
