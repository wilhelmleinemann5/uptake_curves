This way we avoid users wasting time trying to upload files that will not be accepted. \n\n<Example \n  imageSrc=\"./_images/specify-file-requirements.svg\" \n/>\n\n## Loading states\n\nEach selected file has a loading spinner icon while it is being uploaded. When the file is successfully uploaded the icon will change to a close icon.\n\n<Grid2Cols>\n  <Example \n    imageSrc=\"./_images/loading-states-1.svg\" \n    caption=\"The file is uploading.\"\n  />\n  <Example \n    imageSrc=\"./_images/loading-states-2.svg\" \n    caption=\"The file is uploaded.\"\n  />\n</Grid2Cols>\n\n\n## Validation\n\nWhen a file cannot be uploaded successfully the system will return an error and the file will changed to the invalid state and an error message will be shown. The error message should communicate what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.\n\n<Example \n  imageSrc=\"./_images/validation.svg\"\n/>\n\n## File hint text\n\nEach file has a hint text that can be used to provide additional information about the file e.g. uploading progress or file metadata. \n\n<Grid2Cols>\n  <Example \n    imageSrc=\"./_images/file-hint-text-1.svg\" \n    caption=\"Using the hint text to communicate upload progress.\"\n  />\n  <Example \n    imageSrc=\"./_images/file-hint-text-2.svg\" \n    caption=\"Using the hint text to communicate file size.\"\n  />\n</Grid2Cols>\n"
