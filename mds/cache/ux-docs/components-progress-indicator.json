(e.g 2.0 out of 5.2 MB uploaded)\n- Provide informative labels that indicate the progress status (e.g., \"Update 45% complete\")\n- Avoid misleading progress indicators that do not accurately reflect the task's progress.\n- Avoid blocking the entire UI with a progress indicator unless the context requires it.\n- When applicable, include control buttons with a progress indicator for actions such as pause and cancel.\n- Consider using the <PageLink path=\"/components/toast/\">toast component</PageLink> to let users know when progress is completed or has failed. \n\n## Usage\n\nProgress indicators can be embedded in various UI elements like data tables, dashboards, and drawers. However, there are instances where you should avoid using them or opt for the <PageLink path=\"/components/loading-indicator/\">loading indicator</PageLink>.\n\n<div class=\"mds-table mds-table--small mds-table--vertical-lines-solid\">\n  <table>\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th>Scenario</th>\n        <th>Loading indicator</th>\n        <th>Progress indicator</th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Unknown task duration</td>\n        <td><div class=\"flex items-center gap-2\"><Icon icon=\"check-circle-solid\" appearance=\"success\"></Icon><span>Ideal choice</span></div></td>\n        <td><div class=\"flex items-center gap-2\"><Icon icon=\"times-circle-solid\" appearance=\"error\"></Icon><span>Not suitable</span></div></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Known, measurable progress</td>\n        <td><div class=\"flex items-center gap-2\"><Icon icon=\"times-circle-solid\" appearance=\"error\"></Icon><span>Not suitable</span></div></td>\n        <td><div class=\"flex items-center gap-2\"><Icon icon=\"check-circle-solid\" appearance=\"success\"></Icon><span>Ideal choice</span></div></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Brief interactions (&lt;1 second)</td>\n        <td><div class=\"flex items-center gap-2\"><Icon icon=\"times-circle-solid\" appearance=\"error\"></Icon><span>Unnecessary visual noise</span></div></td>\n        <td><div class=\"flex items-center gap-2\"><Icon icon=\"times-circle-solid\" appearance=\"error\"></Icon><span>Unnecessary visual noise</span></div></td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</div>\n\n### When to use\n\n- When task duration and progress can be measured and communicated accurately to manage user’s expectations.\n- When a user initiates processes like uploading shipping documents, generating new schedules, or updating systems with large data sets.\n- In dashboards or detailed tracking views to visualise the completion state of tasks or shipments.\n\n### When not to use\n\n- When task duration or progress cannot be measured reliably, use the <PageLink path=\"/components/loading-indicator/\">loading indicator</PageLink> instead.\n- When loading duration is brief (&lt; 1 sec. ) or instantaneous, avoid progress indicators.\n\n## Variants\n\nThere are two variants of the progress indicator that can be used depending on available space, user expectations, and context. These indicators visually communicate measurable progress from 0% to 100%, helping manage user expectations.\n\n### Ring progress indicator\n\nThe ring progress indicator is a suitable choice for clearly indicating measurable progress in compact or isolated UI elements, such as shipment status cards, dashboard widgets, or detailed tracking views. It helps users quickly assess the current status or percentage completion of logistics tasks and shipments.\n\n<Example \n  imageSrc=\"./_images/ring.png\" \n  imageMaxWidth=\"420px\" \n  caption=\"Ring progress indicator showing the loading progress of a widget’s data where it is replaced by the data after completion.\" \n/>\n\n### Bar progress indicator\n\nThe bar progress indicator is ideal for horizontal spaces, especially in long forms, data tables, dashboards, or header sections. It provides clear visual feedback for tasks such as uploading documents, generating shipment labels, or processing bulk updates, ensuring users have a clear understanding of the current progress state.\n\n<Example \n  imageSrc=\"./_images/bar.png\" \n  imageMaxWidth=\"660px\" \n  caption=\"Bar progress indicator used in table cells where the completed state remains visible for future references.\" \n/>\n\n## Accessibility\n\n- Use adequate colour contrasts between progress indicators and their backgrounds.\n- Make sure ARIA labels are present and represent correctly the label and progress values.\n- In case the progress indicator includes custom interactive elements (e.g., pause, cancel) ensure that they support keyboard navigation.\n- Consider visually hidden status updates via live regions for screen reader users, especially for critical real-time task updates."
