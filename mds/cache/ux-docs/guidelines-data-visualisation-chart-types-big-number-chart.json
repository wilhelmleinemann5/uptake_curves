Multiple big number charts can be displayed in a grid where each tile displays the value of a certain category.\n\n<Example \n  imageSrc=\"./_images/big-number-chart.png\"\n  imageMaxWidth=\"229px\"\n  darkWarning={false}\n  caption=\"A user who wants to know the total carbon emission for current month.\"\n/>\n\n## Best practice\n\n### Provide a short, small title\nUse a few descriptive words for the title and use a smaller font than that of the value.\n\n### Use a big and consistent font for the values\nChoose a large font size to display the value. When there are several big number charts on a dashboard, ensure that they all use the same font size to create a consistent appearance.\n\n### Abbreviate values\nDon't include more precision than the user needs when displaying numbers.\n\n### Show contextual information\nTo provide context to the value, you could include the metric from a previous period, or use a sparkline to show how the metric has performed over a period of time. Another technique is to include the average value or previous highs and lows. If you're working towards a goal, include the target as well as your current progress.\n\n### Add warnings\nYou can add warnings (colours, icons, etc.) when a metric is above or below a certain threshold to make it easier to spot problems."
