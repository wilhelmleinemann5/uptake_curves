However, there are [a few exceptions](https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/writing-si-metric-system-units#capitalization).\n\n<Grid2Cols>\n  <Example \n    indicator=\"success\"\n  >\n    1,000 kg\n  </Example>\n  <Example \n    indicator=\"error\"\n  >\n    1,000 Kg\n  </Example>\n</Grid2Cols>\n\n## Punctuation\n\nA period should not be added at the end of a unit of measurement.\n\n<Grid2Cols>\n  <Example \n    indicator=\"success\"\n  >\n    2,000 kg\n  </Example>\n  <Example \n    indicator=\"error\"\n  >\n    2,000 kg.\n  </Example>\n</Grid2Cols>\n\n## Superscript and subscript\n\nWhen units of measurement represent squared or cubed values, the exponent (i.e. the number 2 or 3) should be raised from the baseline (superscript).\n\n<Grid2Cols>\n  <Example \n    indicator=\"success\" \n    caption=\"Cubic meters represented with superscript\"\n  >\n    10,000 m<sup>3</sup>\n  </Example>\n  <Example \n    indicator=\"error\" \n    caption=\"Cubic meters represented without superscript\"\n  >\n    10,000 m3\n  </Example>\n</Grid2Cols>\n\nSuperscript <sup>(raised)</sup> and subscript <sub>(lowered)</sub> characters should also be used when referring to scientific expressions, such as chemical compounds (H<sub>2</sub>O), math equations (y=x<sup>2</sup>) and physics formulas (E=mc<sup>2</sup>).\n"
