Call it what it is, a magnifying glass.\"\n    imageSrc=\"./_images/naming-1.png\"\n    darkWarning={false}\n  />\n  <Example \n    caption=\"Email or letter? Call it what it is, an envelope.\"\n    imageSrc=\"./_images/naming-2.png\"\n    darkWarning={false}\n  />\n</Grid2Cols>\n\n### Keywords\n\nMake it easier to find icons by adding searchable keywords, don't use product-specific keywords.\n\n<Grid2Cols>\n  <Example \n    caption=\"Keyword examples: alarm, bell, notification.\"\n    imageSrc=\"./_images/keywords-1.png\"\n    darkWarning={false}\n  />\n  <Example \n    caption=\"Keyword examples: box, present, celebration, gift.\"\n    imageSrc=\"./_images/keywords-2.png\"\n    darkWarning={false}\n  />\n</Grid2Cols>\n\n## Clean up\n\nWhen your icon or pictogram is ready, remember to duplicate it before you outline it, this will make it easier if we have to make any updates later on. Make sure you only have one layer and name it Vector, to get the best svg output remove unnecessary vector points.\n\n<Grid2Cols>\n  <Example \n    caption=\"Example where all unnecessary vector points have been removed.\" \n    indicator=\"success\"\n    imageSrc=\"./_images/clean-up-2.png\"\n    darkWarning={false}\n  />\n  <Example \n    caption=\"When using flatten or outline stroke, unnecessary vector points may appear. Cleaning this up will give a better svg output.\"\n    indicator=\"warning\"\n    imageSrc=\"./_images/clean-up-1.png\"\n    darkWarning={false}\n  />\n</Grid2Cols>\n\n## Winding rules\n\nOne last but important step, you have to check how your winding rule are set, you can do that with the plug-in “Fill rule editor” here you want your icon or pictogram to be set to “non-zero rule”. If your icon are blue you a ready to go, if it's orange you are using the wrong winding rule. Click the orange area to change it to non-zero/blue.\n\nWhen changing an icon or pictogram from even-odd to non-zero it is possible that you will see areas being filled instead of transparent, that's easy to fix. Click on the small black arrows to turn their direction. Two arrows going in the same direction will fill your object, and two arrows going in the opposite direction will make your object transparent.\n\n<Grid2Cols>\n  <Example \n    caption=\"To toggle between non-zero rule and even-odd rule simply click the blue or orange area of the icon.\"\n    imageSrc=\"./_images/winding-rules-1.png\"\n    darkWarning={false}\n  />\n  <Example \n    caption=\"Fix this fill error by clicking the inner black arrows to turn their direction.\"\n    imageSrc=\"./_images/winding-rules-2.png\"\n    darkWarning={false}\n  />\n</Grid2Cols>\n"
