Each tag is usually a link that leads to an index page listing all the content associated with that tag/keyword. This way tags allow the user to navigate through content based on keywords rather than a hierarchical structure.\n\nTags are mostly added to content or items informally grouped either by the creator or by the consumer, but can also be chosen from a controlled vocabulary depending on the context.\n\n\n## With action\n\nAn closing action can be applied to the tag. Tags can be permanent or removable depending on the context. For example, removable tags can be used to show the user which filters that has already been applied and thereby also let the user remove individual filters. Permanent tags can be used to communicate the status of a piece of information e.g. \"In progress\" and \"Completed\".\n\n<Example\n  imageSrc=\"./_images/with-action.svg\"\n/>\n\n## Appearances\n\nThe tag component comes in the following appearances:\n\n- Neutral = Grey\n- Info (general information) = Blue\n- Success (positive information) = Green\n- Warning (important information demanding the user's attention) = Yellow\n- Error (critical messages requiring user action) = Red\n\nThe info, success, warning and error tags should be applied according to our guidelines for <PageLink path=\"/components/notification\">notifications</PageLink>.\n"
