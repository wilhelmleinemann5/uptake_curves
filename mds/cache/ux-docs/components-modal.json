When a modal is shown the user's access to the rest of the page is blocked by a semi-transparent backdrop.\n\nSince modals intentionally disrupt the user's workflow, they should be used sparingly and only when in-page alternatives fail at providing the needed information or functionality.\n\n## Size and fit\n\nThe size of a modal can be configured to fit the content and the context of use. The 'size' refers to the outer dimensions of the modal whereas the 'fit' relates to the density of the components within."
