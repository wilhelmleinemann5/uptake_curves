    This is here to help teams to migrate from 'legacy' versions of the Maersk Design System. The layouts in this package are here for historical reasons only and were originally designed to support the Maersk.com content website. We will be re-evaluating these with future iterations of the design system.

  A legacy package of mds scss files. Currently supported components/layouts:

  - fieldset
  - form-group
  - action-card
  - background
  - page hero
  - page section
  - media-image

  The package generates CSS and SCSS files for Maersk, Sealand and Hamburg SÃ¼d brands.


  ## Migration

  To install the package run:

  ```bash
  npm i @maersk-global/mds-legacy
  ```

  Use the following import. Remember to replace the <YOUR_BRAND> with your desired one, which can be `maersk`, `sealand` or `hamburgsud`.

  ```js
  @import "~@maersk-global/mds-legacy/scss/<YOUR_BRAND>";
  ``` 

  You do not need to explicitly improt the @maersk-global/mds-design-token or @maersk-global/mds-foundations.

  If you are migrating from the old mds package, remember to delete the old imports.
