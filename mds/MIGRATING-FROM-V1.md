## Community components

MDS community components have been deprecated in favour of the new [Community UI](https://designsystem.maersk.com/community-ui/initiatives/#code-libraries) library.

# Design tokens

**Design tokens and themes other than Maersk in v1 were not officially supported by the MDS.**

v1 design tokens and themes have been completely re-written for v2.

Design tokens are officially supported from v2 onwards. Please read the changes below carefully.

Read more about [themes and design tokens](https://designsystem.maersk.com/themes/).

## New folder structure

The new path must be used in place of the old one.

Replace the `<brand_name>` with one of the following: `maersk` or `apmt`:

**hamburgsud and sealand are no longer supported**

```javascript
import '@maersk-global/mds-design-tokens/<brand_name>/light/css/design-tokens-px.css';
```

```javascript
import '@maersk-global/mds-design-tokens/maersk/light/css/design-tokens-px.css';
```

# CSS

**The CSS foundations has had a major overhaul in v2. Please read the changes below carefully.**

## New folder structure

New dist folder structure for the `@maersk-global/mds-foundations` package:

- SASS is now bundled `scss/*.scss`
- CSS has been moved to its own folder `css/foundations.css` &amp; `css/foundations.min.css`

The foundations package should be imported using the new paths (containing extra CSS segment) e.g.:

```javascript
import '@maersk-global/mds-foundations/css/foundations.css';
```

Additionally, remember to apply the `mds` class name to the root container of the sections in your page where the MDS foundations are required.

## mds-rich-text

**The `mds-rich-text` class is no longer supported.**

All CSS classes are now scoped to the `mds` class, you have to add `mds` class to an outer container wrapper, e.g. `<body>`.

In addition there is new a `mds-content` class. Adding this class to a container element e.g. `<article>` will provide spacing/margins for headers, paragraphs, unordered lists etc.

## Typography class name changes

| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| mds-table--vertical-grid-lines    | mds-table--vertical-lines-solid           |
| mds-table--no-wrap                | mds-table--nowrap                         |
| mds-table--hidden-header          | mds-table--header-hidden                  |
| mds-table--row-highlight-on-hover | mds-table--disable-row-highlight-on-hover |

## Other

- `clearfix` is no longer support

# Deprecated packages

The following packages have been deprecated with v2:

- `@maersk-global/mds-ie11`
- `@maersk-global/mds-react-components` in favour of `@maersk-global/mds-react-wrapper`. See below.
- `@maersk-global/mds-ssr-react`
- `@maersk-global/mds-v2-legacy` use `@maersk-global/mds-legacy` instead
- `@maersk-global/vite-plugin-mds-ie11`
- `@maersk-global/vue-cli-plugin-mds-ie11`

## Migration from @maersk-global/mds-react-web-components

The below migration path guides the current users of our former React wrapper `@maersk-global/mds-react-web-components` to move to `@maersk-global/mds-react-wrapper`:

Uninstall the `@maersk-global/mds-react-web-components` by running:

```bash
npm uninstall @maersk-global/mds-react-web-components --save
```

Install the `@maersk-global/mds-react-wrapper` by running:

```bash
npm install @maersk-global/mds-react-wrapper --save
```

Rename all the imports on `@maersk-global/mds-react-web-components` to `@maersk-global/mds-react-wrapper`, look the example below:

```javascript
import { McButton } from '@maersk-global/mds-react-web-components';
/** The package name above should be renamed, like below: **/
import { McButton } from '@maersk-global/mds-react-wrapper';
```

All event bindings stay the same as they are, the only change is the structure of the event arguments. Now the passing event object is aligned with how `CustomEvent`s work in the sense that the root of the passing event arg now contains overall data around the event itself and the payload resides in the `detail` property in that object. If TypeScript is applied, then you can even specify the type of the payload using the generic type of the `CustomEvent` type.

The example below illustrates how the refinement should take place to migrate the code from the former wrapper to the new one on i.e. an `McSelect` element:

```html
// Event binding with the former wrapper
<McSelect
  name="skills"
  placeholder="Select your skills"
  variant="multiple"
  fit={fit}
  options={skillsOptions}
  change={(selectedStatus: {
    selectedIndexes: [];
    selectedOptions: { label: string; value: string }[];
  }, event: CustomEvent) => {
    console.log('selected skills: ', selectedStatus);
  }}
></McSelect>

// Event binding with the new wrapper (code above should be migrated to below)
<McSelect
  name="skills"
  placeholder="Select your skills"
  variant="multiple"
  fit={fit}
  options={skillsOptions}
  change={(event: CustomEvent<{ selectedIndexes: []; selectedOptions: string[] }>) => {
    console.log('selected skills: ', event.detail);
  }}
></McSelect>
```

If React is used along with TypeScript, now there's no longer a need to have the following setting in the `tsconfing.json` file and it should be removed:

```json
{
  "files": ["./node_modules/@maersk/react-web-components/types/index.d.ts"]
}
```

## Removal of IE11
