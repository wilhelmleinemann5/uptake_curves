# Hey there o/! 
# 
# We just wanted to let you know that we care a great deal about    
# making our git history clean, maintainable and easy to access for 
# all our contributors. Commit messages are very important to us,  
# which is why we have a strict commit message policy in place.     
# Please use the following guidelines to format all your commit     
# messages:
# 
#     <type>: <subject>
# 
# Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that         
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a   
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is providing. Allowed types are:
#             * feat (feature)
#             * fix (bug fix)
#             * docs (documentation)
#             * style (formatting, missing semicolons, …)
#             * refactor
#             * test (when adding missing tests)
#             * chore (maintain)
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in the following format:
#             * imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed”/“changes”
#             * no capitalized first letter
#             * no dot (.) at the end
# 
# Thank you <3
